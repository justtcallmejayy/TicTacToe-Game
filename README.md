## About <a name = "about"></a>

Tic Tac Toe is a simple, fun, and interactive two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to alternate turns, placing X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. It's a great way to showcase beginner-level skills in web development and game logic implementation.
